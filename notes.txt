THINGS TO ASK ABOUT DURING NEXT MEETING

On the sign up page, is this all they want/ should I remove the nav so its cleaner?
it would just be the link to the home page


Book Details
Do we want to have their story listed somewhere? for some reason I didnt think
we wanted it



For storing signing up

my process.

They put their name and email.

When they press send, an email is sent to them with a link that will take them
to a sign up page. based off of the link they click, it takes them to a sign up
form that has their most of their information filled in

link will take them to the sign up page and load their information in the form based off of
their user id which will be tacked on at the end of the link

all they would need to add is a password

once that is done take them to their profile and allow them to change
their details.

One thing that may need to be done is to create unique id's like a random
20 digit string so it would be harder to change up the links and
sign up as different people?

// How we salt the password, used for later




The way that I have this set up is that only one email can be user per db
So a worker cant be a worker and a book, will ask ab this


//Ask travis how to use the quill thing



Next thing, working on admins being able to email everyone
